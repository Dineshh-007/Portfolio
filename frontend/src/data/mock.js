  summary: `Early‑career software engineer pursuing an Integrated M.Tech in Software Engineering at VIT Vellore (2024–Present).
    I enjoy turning algorithms into usable products—especially supervised ML with scikit‑learn—and sharpening DSA and
    system‑design fundamentals. I learn fast, collaborate well, and like optimizing code for clarity and performance.
    Open to internships, projects, and mentorship in AI/ML and software engineering.`,
